            <h4>
                Staring at the countless square patterns.<br>
                Noticed the photo of power strips.<br>
                Noticed the photo of the artist with glasses.<br>
                Wondering how the webpage might react in response to the width. <br>
                Noticed the photo of his black cat which looks furious.<br>
                Noticed there are few things to interact with, clickable points which you can unclick, animated letters including “.,*,”, and a slider.<br>
                Clicked the closing button of the cat and closed the section.<br>
                Tried the slider to decrease the corners of the squares.<br> 
                Unclicked and clicked dot points. <br>
                Closed a few more sections of the webpage.<br>
                And finally read the text. <br>
                Which lead me into Sandspiel which is one of his projects, and played it for a few minutes which was definitely fun. <br>

            <h4>
                I was looking at the intense square patterns and thought about how to actually create these patterns in html and css. 
                I also noticed that there are many little interactive elements on this page and while I was playing with these little things, it definitely drew my attention to spend more time on his portfolio page which I thought was impressive. 
                So I thought I also wanted to include much interactivity when I make my portfolio website so audiences can spend more time having fun with my works.

            <h4>
                At first, I was engaging with various little things like clicking and unclicking the dots and deleting the contents from the page. Adjusting the corners of the square patterns using the slider bar was exciting! I was increasing and decreasing the corners and looking at how the main page reacted to the slider. I was also looking at how all of the elements are automatically arranged differently in the main page after deleting the contents and also adjusting the size of the browser. 
                At last, once I got into the sand game, I think I was spending a lot of time enjoying the game so much!

                4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?

            <h4>
                I thought that this was a fun engaging portfolio webpage which has many elements to interact with the audiences and I really enjoyed interacting with them. I liked how he managed to include little details in interactions, even if it does not have any functional purposes, for instance, check buttons which you can turn it on and off and nothing pops up or anything, it’s just for the sake of clicking the dot point. I think I was just clicking everything for the most part of my action to make sure I do not miss a thing.

            </h2>
            <h4>
                The intended primary goal of this interactive website seems to be to make sure the audiences enjoy spending time on his webpage. While he offers enjoyment, he also introduced his distinctive fun personality as an artist. I also liked how he shared his photos of himself and his cat, although I’m not certain if the cat is his, it does feel like he is welcoming the audience by introducing his pet. :) he did successfully present himself with his artistic style using repetitive square patterns along with various interactive elements. I think his portfolio site is welcoming and fun which makes me interested in looking into his works.

            <h4>
                By letting the audience enjoy various interactive features of the website in order to let the audience spend more time on his folio site. If the audience spent some time on the page, it means they had fun and now became interested in looking into other works of this artist. So they are now ready to see other works and when they do look into the actual works, they will be more attentive and active. It will definitely increase the opportunity for the artist to draw more attention from the audience, especially when they have tons of portfolio pages to examine for the available job.

                7. What is your impression of the intended length of a single interaction and how often you are intended to interact with the experience?
            </h2>
            <h4>
                Among various interactions of the page, there are ones which ends with a click and there are also others which takes a few mins. <br>
                The example of the short length of interactions are clicking and unclicking the tiny dot points and checker boxes, deleting certain section, or adjusting the square corner sizes. 
                The longer length of interaction can be looking into his other works or playing the sand game.<br>
                However, even with the shorter interactions, I did not just finish interacting with the element with just a click, I kept interacting with them until I got bored of it. And with the sand game, once I got into the game, I spend a few minutes right away, however, I did not go back to play it again. But after coming back to the main page, I was still interacting with some of the shorter length of interactions again. <br>
                In total, I think I definitely spend more time than 2 minutes, probably at least 15 minutes when I first visited the page. I would like to visit the webpage again later as a reference for my folio works.

            <h4>
                Although this is a portfolio webpage, the artist included photos of himself, his cat, and the power strip which makes it look like his personal blog. With these photos, I feel like it gives a more natural and welcoming feeling as if I am looking at one of my friend’s personal blogs.

            <h4>
                 I think the artist wanted the audience to have fun playing with various little elements. When I was clicking the check boxes or the dot points, I felt like I was playing “a digital pop it,” which is a fidget toy usually made out of silicon and has many pokable bubbles. The pop-it is supposed to help you with releasing your stress or emptying your busy minds, and surprisingly, I enjoyed playing with the dots and check boxes as well. The whole experience was fun. Oh actually, I enjoyed the sand game so much! I definitely want to play it again.

            <h4>
                I think the most frustrating part of the experience was that I could never open the section again after I deleted it. I know all things will be reset if the page is refreshed, but I wanted to have a choice of re-opening the selected section, not resetting everything. Also, the square patterns are making these empty spaces where there is no pattern at all. Whenever you adjust the size of the browser, the empty spaces also get changed as well. I did not like looking at those empty spaces. I think it’s because it makes the folio page look disorganised and unfinished, as if the coding work is not properly done with the patterns.

            <h4>
                I liked the slider bar to adjust the corners of the patterns. I liked how the artist gave the audience the choice of adjusting them. I thought this was a creative and interesting interactive element. It was interesting to see how the patterns all change at the same time. Also when the browser size was varied, I liked how the patterns are also responsive to different screen sizes. I think it was satisfying to me because the artist offered a choice of creating the pattern in the way I want. I think it is almost  like playing a part in designing this website together with the artist and I really liked that idea.
